# soundcloud-scraper
This is a personal project I am putting together to learn more about the network of artists that I follow on Soundcloud (SC).

SOUNDCLOUD_CONNECTIONS is a python program that queries the SC API and returns a dictionary of all the artists that I follow, 
and all the artists they follow (2 degrees of seperation). Then for each of those artists, builds a list of artists that they 
follow in order to build a kind of network.

LIKES_TRACKER also gathers all the artists I follow and all the artists they follow, and tracks how many likes each artist has
day after day. This will eventually be used to see who's growing most in popularity amongst my "network"
